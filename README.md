# Hi, I'm Ares👋
Software Developer & AI Engineer with a strong focus on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Cybersecurity-related systems.


I enjoy building end-to-end ML pipelines — from data preprocessing and 
feature engineering to model evaluation and real-time prediction.


Currently working on projects involving image processing, CNN-based models, and ML-driven applications, and creating structured learning guides for students and self-learners.
