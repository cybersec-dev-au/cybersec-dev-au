# Hi, I'm Ares👋
Software Developer & AI Engineer with a strong focus on Machine Learning, 
Computer Vision, and ML-based Security Systems.

I enjoy building end-to-end ML pipelines — from data preprocessing and 
feature engineering to model evaluation and real-time prediction.


Currently working on projects involving image processing, CNN-based models, and ML-driven applications, and creating structured learning guides for students and self-learners.

## 🧭 Guides & Learning Roadmaps

I also create beginner-to-intermediate guides and roadmaps to help students
and self-learners understand AI, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision
through structured learning paths and real projects.
